# Information-Retrieval-from-VK.com

Academic project, written for course "Information retrieval" (Oct 2014 - Feb 2015)

Together with partner we:  
-Came up with a project idea (search system, that indexes posts of some news groups in VK.com)  
-Implemented and presented it  

My part was backend development:  
-Building inverse index for up to 500k documents  
-Performing lemmatization with MyStem library  
-Building a syntax for querying, with automatic expansion of every query keyword to it's synonyms  
-Parsing VK groups with API to gather posts  

This repository contains only pieces of code written by me, that are relevant to this project.
